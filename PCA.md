Curse of Dimentionality - More Dimension = Greater Sparsity of Information -> Most Datapoints are 0

PCA:
  1) Calculate Mean for Each Dimension
  2) Find center of data Using Means from (1)
  3) Shift the data, so the center is at the origin
  4) Find line of best fit (line must cross the origin) -> Principal Component 1
    4.a) Minimize Squared Distance from Datapoints to the Line, or
    4.b) Maximize Distance from Datapoints to the Origin {You can find why in textbooks}
  5) Find PC2 -> Perpendicular to PC1 (4)


PCA Using Linear Algebra:
